This is the Analyzer part for fluoride: a tool to whiten the black boxes that Rails apps can become.

The idea here is:

0. Download a set of fluoride exchange .yml files generated by fluoride-collector
0. Generate a list of routes actually hit in production
0. Generate a scaffold set of request specs for producing quick test coverage
