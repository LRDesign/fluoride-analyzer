This is the Analyzer part for fluoride: a tool to whiten the black boxes that Rails apps can become.

The idea here is:

0. Download a set of fluoride exchange .yml files generated by fluoride-collector
0. Generate a list of routes actually hit in production
0. Generate a scaffold set of request specs for producing quick test coverage


To set this up in a Rails app:

add

```
gem 'fluoride-collector'
```
to your Gemfile

`bundle install`

Create a file at lib/tasks/fluoride.rb with:
```
require 'fluoride-analyzer/tasklib'

Fluoride::Analyzer::Tasklib.new
```

Check that it worked:
`bundle exec rake -T` should include 'fluoride:analyzer:template_request_specs'

Make a directory called 'fluoride/request_recordings' and put the fluoride 
captures there.

Run `bundle exec rake fluoride:analyzer:template_request_specs'

The result should be a directory 'fluoride/spec/requests' filled with 
automatically generated request specs.

Now starts the process of moving those specs to your normal spec directory and 
making them pass. Generally, the specs will fail because they ran against a 
live app, and the test environment doesn't have e.g. database records that the 
live app does - you'll need to mock or factory records so that the request 
specs will pass.
